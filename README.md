# Flight-Website

A website designed to be a more robust update log for my flight project than the README in the repo. It will include both update logs for updates that I deem that are major and showcasing some models that I have created. I may plan on creating another tab to showcase more specific features like a small battle scenario or some weapons in action.

### Website Link
The live version is located [here](https://app.netlify.com/projects/unrealenginepersonalflightproject/overview)

### Tech Stack
- Vite + React.js
- TailwindCSS
