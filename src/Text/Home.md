Welcome to my Unreal Engine 5 Flight Project website! A quick overview of what this project hopes to accomplish and what you can expect in future updates. The plan for this project is to create a mix between a Flight Game like Ace Combat and a Flight Simulator like War Thunder and DCS. This means blending the simplicity of controls that comes with Ace Combat with the more "energy" style of combat of War Thunder, whilst still maintaining a relatively high level of arcade flight logic. Another big endeavour I hope to bring to this project is extreme weather (tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, etc.) in order to create a more dynamic atmosphere and create more objects for players to dodge.
