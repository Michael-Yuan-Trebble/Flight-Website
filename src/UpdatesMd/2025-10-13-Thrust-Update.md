2025-10-13 | Thrust Updated

Thrust has been adjusted and more safety guards have been added. Drag from Angle of Attack and Climb/Dive angles have also been added. Currently drag is very small due to testing other features, however these will be increased greatly in the future. This is to make the player manage their energy states in a better manner and to make movement feal more dynamic.
