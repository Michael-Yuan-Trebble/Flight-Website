Missiles now have a simple explosion effect whenever they are destroyed. I have also change how the weapon system communicates with the HUD, now it is a delegate that communicates to the controller, which then sets the HUD. I have also grouped up both missiles into a base missile class as the two are incredibly similar on many aspects.
